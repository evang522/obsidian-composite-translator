- I want to be able to choose which translator I will use in the settings.
  - I want to be able to add expected configuration options to the settings depending on what translation service it is.
- I want to, while writing a note, be able to use a quick shortcut to open up a translator window which will translate any text I enter.
- I also want to be able to fully translate a specific note by running a shortcut which will open a dialogue
  - The dialogue should ask me if I want the full translation added in a new file or appended to the existing one. 
  - The translator will then take all the text, translate it, and then perform the selected action.
